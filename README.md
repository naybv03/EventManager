1. Clone this repository.
```

cd EventManager
```

2. Run the following command to install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   yarn install
   pnpm install
   bun install
   ```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Contributing
First of all, pull the latest changes on the remote master branch
```
git pull --ff-only origin master
```
Create a new branch and start working on it:
```
git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
```
Make sure you worked in a single functionality
Then, add the changes and make the commit
```
git add .
git commit -m "Add <feature-name>"
```
Push the changes to the remote master branch
```
git push origin <new-branch-name>
```
Go to github and make a pull request

This process needs to be repeated every time you worked on a new functionality, try no to push changes on the master branch directly or the pull request will be close

Any doubt ask me, Diego, or open an issue

Love you <3
